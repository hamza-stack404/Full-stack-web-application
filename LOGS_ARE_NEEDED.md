## I Need Your Help to Fix This: Please Provide the Backend Logs

I understand the "Could not validate credentials" error is frustrating. I am doing my best to help you, but I am currently blocked. **I cannot solve this issue without the backend logs.**

### Why the Logs are Essential

The error message "Could not validate credentials" is a general one. It can be caused by several different issues. The backend logs are like a black box recorder for the application - they contain the detailed, step-by-step information of what the application was doing, and why it failed.

Without the logs, I am working with very limited information. With the logs, I can see:

*   If the database connection to your Neon DB was successful.
*   If the application is correctly trying to find the user in the database.
*   The exact point where the authentication process is failing.

### How to Get the Logs (A Reminder)

1.  **Start the application** using `start_all.bat`.
2.  **Trigger the error** in your application's frontend.
3.  **Copy the entire output** from the backend terminal.
4.  **Paste the logs** here in the chat.

I am confident that with the logs, I can quickly identify the root cause of this error and provide a solution. Please provide the logs so we can get you back on track.
